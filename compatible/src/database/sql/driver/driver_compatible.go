// A Connector represents a driver in a fixed configuration
// and can create any number of equivalent Conns for use
// by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Connector can be passed to sql.OpenDB, to allow drivers
// to implement their own sql.DB constructors, or returned by
// DriverContext's OpenConnector method, to allow drivers
// access to context and to avoid repeated parsing of driver
// configuration.

	// Connect may return a cached connection (one previously
	// closed), but doing so is unnecessary; the sql package
	// maintains a pool of idle connections for efficient re-use.
	//
	// The provided context.Context is for dialing purposes only
	// (see net.DialContext) and should not be stored or used for
	// other purposes.

	// The returned connection is only used by one goroutine at a
	// time.
